# OWASP A7 Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
*Much of the day will be focused aroung a Live Hacker Content. Prepare yourself by watching the video given below. I will set up a simple “hackable” Session based Server. The first one to succeed in stealing a SessionID, and another user's secret information, and explain for the class “the steps involved” wins a GOOD beer :-)*

### Snippet-file for today
[TBD](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sGegv6K4DeDuTAmXMhepzAaeDfDjIqWNIpj-jLL-kcI/edit?usp=sharing)

### What to read

- Read the OWASP Description for [A7](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10-2017_A7-Cross-Site_Scripting_(XSS)) (10 min.)
- Read/skim the OWASP [XSS Prevention Cheat Sheet](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/XSS_(Cross_Site_Scripting)_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet) (5-10 min. - skim only)
- Read/skim the article the [Cheat Sheet related to session management](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Session_Management_Cheat_Sheet) (same as for day-1)

- **Important** Watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbmBDiR6WaY) (7 min.) about Cross Site Scripting and Session Hijacking. Play close attention to the malicious scripts used in this video, since you will be expected to attack a “similar” site Friday, and implement a “similar” proof of concept server by yourself
